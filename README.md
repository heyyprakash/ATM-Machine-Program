# ATM-Machine-Program
Project Description: AMT Machine Interface

The AMT Machine Interface is a Python-based application designed to simulate an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) experience. Users can perform the following actions:

Check Balance:
Users input their account details (account number and PIN).
The interface retrieves and displays the account balance.
Withdrawal:
Users specify the withdrawal amount.
The system deducts the requested amount from the account balance (if sufficient funds are available).
Deposit:
Users input the deposit amount.
The system adds the deposited amount to the account balance.
Change PIN:
Users can change their PIN for security purposes.
The interface validates the old PIN and updates it with the new one.
Transaction History:
Users can view a summary of recent transactions (e.g., withdrawals, deposits).
Key Components:

Python: The primary programming language.
Console Interface: Utilize a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
